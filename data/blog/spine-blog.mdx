# What are you doing PK !?

What's up, folks?

Lately, I've been diving into a project that breaks the monotony of my usual routine - eat, sleep, repeat.

### So, What Am I Up To?

---

Currently, my focus is on developing a book tracking application called **_SPINE_**. I've written the entire backend code using NestJS, an awesome framework for building server-side applications with Node.js. If you're interested, you can check out the backend code repository

[GitHub - wfkpk/spine-backend](https://github.com/wfkpk/spine-backend)

### Features, Anyone?

Let me give you a rundown of the fantastic features that SPINE has to offer:

0. Authentication - for secure access.
1. Add books to three primary lists.
2. Perform lightning-fast searches using Meilisearch.
3. Update everything effortlessly.
4. Import additional books from external sources to expand the database.
5. Attach multiple private notes to a single book.
6. Engage in discussions by adding multiple comments to a book.

### Tech Stack - What's Under the Hood?

Let's take a look at the technology stack powering SPINE:

- NestJS backend - the framework of choice.
- Meilisearch - for robust search capabilities.
- PostgreSQL - the database of choice.
- Firebase Auth - ensuring secure authentication.

### Why Book Tracking?

While browsing through GitHub, I embarked on a quest to find a good book tracking client but was left disappointed. Who in their right mind scours GitHub for applications, you might ask? Well, I do! I wanted something different from the popular Goodreads platform. Don't get me wrong, Goodreads is great, but I craved an open-source alternative with a smaller user base.

Now, you might be wondering about the frontend aspect. Frankly, I have a love-hate relationship with frontend development. So, for now, I'll stick to sending requests to my server for adding or deleting books from the list, relying on the JSON responses for operations. I'll patiently wait for someone to step up and create something cool with it. Oh, and by the way, I'm currently exploring frontend development and plan to build Spine's Next.js web application in the coming weeks. Also, I've been doing some website scraping and collecting data, which might just be the topic of my next blog post.

That's a wrap, folks! Catch you later.
