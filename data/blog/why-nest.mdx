# Introduction

Hey there,

I wanted to write something on the internet, and here is the start!

### Why NestJS!?

NestJS is simply awesome. It not only provides support for microservices (even though I might not use them, it's still a plus), but it is also a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.

When I was a noob and had no idea which technology to choose for backend development, I was already familiar with TypeScript and had a good understanding of system design principles, including monolith and microservice architecture (both of which are essential parts of system design).

That's when I thought, "Let's give NestJS a try!" And so, the journey began. NestJS and I quickly became friends and had a little chat.

NestJS: "Hey Pk, wanna build something cool?"

Me: "Yeah, but I have no clue what to build. I just landed here."

NestJS: "Don't worry, lil bruhh, I got you. Let's start with a small application that performs CRUD operations with a database of your choice."

Me: "Sounds cool!"

Me: "I don't know much about any ORMs. Can you suggest a few?"

NestJS: "Ah, you can use Prisma, TypeORM, or Drizzle ORM. Drizzle is new, by the way, so for now, stick with any one of them. Got it!?"

Me: "Yes, I think I'll go with Prisma. I've used Prisma with TypeScript before."

NestJS: "Let the fun begin!"

3 hours later...

Me: "I did it!"

Me: "Wanna take a look and review my code with testing!?"

NestJS: "Looks cool! You did it!"

Me: "What's next?"

NestJS: "You can build one more application."

Me: "I was thinking of implementing authentication!"

NestJS: "Let's do this!"

Me: "I know Firebase has a good tier. Should I use that and build the application on top of Firebase Auth with NestJS, perhaps?"

NestJS: "Sounds cool. I'm going on a business trip, but I'll work on that, and then we can review this project."

Me: "Cool, cool... Thanks, NestJS! You're the best! By the way, you have great documentation."

And then NestJS left for the business trip, while I continued hanging around with the NestJS framework.
